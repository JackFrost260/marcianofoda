		- Big update! If you see any issues, delete Weather Maker from your project and re-add.
		- Additional tweaks and fixes for Mirror networking.
		- Tested with uMMORPG with headless Linux server and multiple players.
		- Add cloud noise generator. This allows easy customization of the shape and detail texture for the clouds. Noise generation uses profiles for ease of use and extra cutomizability. Window -> WeatherMaker -> Cloud Noise Editor.

		- Light manager no longer requires that you add suns and moons manually. This is done automatically now. Any directional light with a WeatherMakerCelestialObject script becomes a sun or moon. Use the IsSun property to tell Weather Maker if it is a sun or moon.
		- Add shaft multiplier to WeatherMakerCelestialObjectScript. This allows you to brighten up fog and clouds shafts per directional light, especially for moons.
		- All moons cast shafts now if their shaft multiplier is greater than 0.
		- Start adding support for multiple suns. This is not ready yet, but is a work in progress.

		- Fix fog shadows and light, especially in deferred rendering.
		- Fix deferred rendering in VR.
		- Raise bias on sun and moon shadows to help reduce artifacts.

		- Null zone culling and strength parameter.
		- Fix precipitation not showing on Unity 2018.3.
		- Bug fixes of course!

5.0.0	(2019-01-02)
		- BIG UPDATE! Please backup your project and remove Weather Maker before updating.
		- *IMPORTANT* Unity 2018.3 crashes when opening Weather Maker on MAC OS X. Please use an earlier Unity version until Unity fixes this bug.
		- Volumetric Clouds! Beautiful, 3D clouds are now in Weather Maker! It's been a long several months and lots of late nights but they are finally ready. Please view the tutorial video in readme.txt to learn all about them.
		- Weather Maker now uses screen space shadows for overlay effects (full screen snow). If your platform cannot support screen space shadows, then the snow overlay will not have shadows. Volumetric clouds cast screen space shadows.
		- Added new performance profiles, this matches up with Unity quality settings. Available on root of prefab in WeatherMakerScript.
		- Depth aware and alpha aware blur and up-scale for clouds and fog.
		- Temporal reprojection for clouds and volumetric fog/lights to spread rendering over multiple frames, greatly enhancing performance.
		- Improve performance by using integers for all shader properties instead of strings.

		- Fix moon to not show stars behind at dawn/dusk.
		- Remove water forward base+forward add pass. Too much code to maintain. One pass all light option is the only option now for water.
		- Unity 2017.4 latest patch or newer required. Dropped support for older Unity versions.
		- Improved dithering/banding reduction of lights in fog, especially at night.
		- Improved volumetric fog spot light performance.
		- Remove noise mask for flat clouds, texture sampler slots were needed for volumetric clouds. May add in the future if I figure out how to stay under 17 samplers.
		- DX9 no longer supported. Shader target 3.5+ required for all shaders in Weather Maker.

4.3.2	(2018-10-09)
		- Add WeatherVolumeModifier property to audio manager to allow controlling the weather sound volumes separately from the ambient sound volumes.
		- Add tesselated water materials for more detailed waves, at a cost of some performance. Tesselated water properties are at bottom of material properties for water.
		- Add displacement options for tesselated water. Non-tesselated water will not have displacement options.

4.3.1	(2018-10-05)

		- Fix fog sphere and box to better handle increased fog density.
		- Add fog factor multiplier to fog profile. This can help get really dense fog even in small fog volumes.
		- Added dampening zone script with lightning light reduction. This combines and replaces all other dampening scripts which have been deleted. WeatherMakerNullZoneClosed prefab has this built in, or you can use WeatherMakerDampeningZone prefab.

4.1.1	(2018-09-20)
		- Reduce shader keyword usage, this should have no performance impact as modern mobile and desktop GPU handle uniform branch basically for free.
		- Improve cloud light performance - only spot, point and area lights that intersect the cloud area are processed.

4.1.0	(2018-09-13)
		- Water:
			- Unified water shader and prefab. No more separate underwater and water objects and shaders. Revert your water prefabs to get the changes.
			- Better appearance and performance for water fog.
			- Reduce sun intensity as camera depth under water increases.
			- Temporarily remove water foam, water waves and water volumetric light/shadows. There were performance and appearance issues. They will be back in a future update.
		- Precipitation:
			- Tweak particle systems. Local space particle systems will now anchor slightly opposite of the wind direction to ensure more visibility of particles.
			- Fix snow overlay covering water.
			- Fix full screen fog not reflecting properly in water.

4.0.2	(2018-09-10)
		- Auto blend y param of water can be set to 0 for no fade, which results in much better refraction at the expense of sharper shorelines.
		- Water reflection now uses vertex lit pipeline for improved performance and stability.
		- Increase wind impact on snow particles.
		- Disable shore foam properties on water material. It was quite buggy anyway. Foam may return in a future version.
		- Handle orthographic size changes with 2D clouds.
		- Add lots of objects to water demo (thanks to catlikecoding.com for sharing).

4.0.1	(2018-09-09)
		- Release follow up with bug fixes, including transition duration / hold fix for weather zone.
		- Null zones can have negative fade for special overlay handling. Hover over fade and read tooltip for details.

4.0.0	(2018-09-07)
		*** BIG UPDATE - BACKUP YOUR PROJECT FIRST IF UPGRADING ***
		This release contains hundreds of hours of work from me. I really hope that you like it. I've tried my very best to make it awesome, performant and bug free.
		Please contact me if you have issues with this update and I will try to help, or I can give you the previous version (3.9.2). This new version has a few breaking API / prefab changes.
		You will need to delete the WeatherMaker folder and re-download the asset as several scripts have been renamed and/or moved.
		You will need to delete and re-add any Weather Maker prefabs or water prefabs to your scenes.
		Please watch the tutorial videos that explains everything about the new setup (see readme.txt).
		- General:
			- Added weather zones. Apply a weather profile or profile group to a collider including nested weather zone support. Please view the tutorial video to learn what this means, and what other prefab changes there are.
			- Make the configuration panel a separate prefab, no longer in WeatherMakerPrefab.
			- Vegetation studio integration: use a weather zone on a vegetation studio area, control snow/rain amount (see WeatherMakerWeatherZoneScript.cs).
			- Remove the weather manager entirely. This is replaced by weather zones and weather profile groups, which have all the capability the weather manager used to have. I've created several weather profile groups for you.
			- Changed weather profiles to use fog, precipitation, wind, audio and lightning profiles. You will need to update any weather profiles to use this new mechanism.
			- Remove IgnoreCameras. Add AllowCameras property to WeatherMakerScript. This will default to main camera, but you can add more. This script is on the root of the prefab. Every other camera is ignored by default.
			- Extensions must be manually added now, they are not automatic anymore. There were too many people running into problems with them getting added automatically.
			- Drop gles 2.0 support. You must use gles 3.0 or newer.
		- Null Zones
			- Null fog zone is now just null zone - because they can block more than fog.
			- Null zones can now block precipitation, fog, snow overlay and under-water fog. This can be changed via mask property on null fog zone script. Requires soft particles enabled to block precipitation.
			- Null zones can be rotated now, great for indoor environments and buildings.
		- Sky:
			- Refactor celestial objects to be a separate script that you attach to your directional light. See the Sun and Moon under WeatherMakerPrefab. Celestial object references for light are now on the light manager.
		- Fog:
			- Fog profile now animates smoothly between all fog profile settings - even noise.
			- Fog box and fog sphere volumetric light only processes lights that intersect the bounds, greatly improving performance.
		- Audio:
			- Move audio settings to new audio manager class.
			- Audio settings are now optionally part of the weather profile. This allows you to replace the global sounds that follow the player depending on the type of weather.
		- Water:
			- Improve underwater appearance and capabilities, including adding a fog box to underwater area.
			- Add underwater ambient and splash sound.
			- Add sound zone dampener to under water area.
			- You will need to add post processing volume to underwater object for now with depth of field and color grading. I will add this once I drop support for older Unity versions.
		- Wind:
			- Tweak wind to behave better with precipitation and trees. More realistic velocities, turbulence, etc.
